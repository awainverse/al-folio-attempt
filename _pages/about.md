I am a Ph.D. candidate in <a href="https://www.math.ucla.edu/">UCLA's Math department</a>, working with <a href="https://www.math.ucla.edu/~chernikov/">Artem Chernikov</a>.
I'm interested in model theory as it relates to combinatorics and other fields.
I graduated in 2018 with a B.S. in mathematics from <a href="http://pma.divisions.caltech.edu/research-and-academics/mathematics">Caltech</a>.

I also teach at the <a href="https://circles.math.ucla.edu/circles/">Olga Radko Math Circle</a>.
